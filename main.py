### üåü Introduction to OptiAuth

OptiAuth is an advanced AI-driven attendance management system developed by BrightSolution. This platform leverages cutting-edge facial recognition technology, focusing on eye region embeddings, to provide a secure, accurate, and efficient solution for student registration and attendance tracking. Designed for educational institutions, it supports multiple courses and offers real-time processing with a professional user interface.

### üéØ What It Does

- **Student Registration**: Enroll students by capturing facial biometrics, roll numbers, names, and course details.
- **Attendance Marking**: Automatically detect and log attendance using single or group photos with AI-powered recognition.
- **Attendance Dashboard**: Visualize attendance records and summaries for insightful analysis.
- **Scalable Design**: Supports course-specific management with FAISS indexing for fast similarity searches.

### üöß Deployment Issue

Unfortunately, due to a dependency conflict with OpenCV (`libGL.so.1` not available in the Streamlit Cloud environment), we are unable to deploy this application directly on Streamlit at this time. The system requires a headless environment setup, which is challenging to configure on the free tier of Streamlit Cloud.

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Run Locally

You can explore and use OptiAuth by cloning the project from our GitHub repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/BrightsSolution/OptiAuth
   cd optiauth
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Create a virtual environment: `python3.12 -m venv venv`
   - Activate it: `source venv/bin/activate` (or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows)
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Install System Dependencies** (Ubuntu/Debian):
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y libpng-dev libjpeg-dev libz-dev
   pip install opencv-python-headless
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```
   streamlit run main.py
   ```
   Access it at `http://localhost:8501`.
